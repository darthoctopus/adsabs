# SAO/NASA ADS Emulator

ADS Classic is going away, but its replacement requires Javascript and doesn't work on text-based browsers/simple accessibility tools. The ADS team has no plans for an accessible version at this time. What do?

I made a workaround so that I can continue to use elinks in the office instead of getting distracted by the siren call of cat pictures on a different browser tab.
