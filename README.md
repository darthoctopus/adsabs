# SAO/NASA ADS Emulator

ADS Classic is going away, but its replacement requires Javascript and doesn't work on text-based browsers/simple accessibility tools. The ADS team has no plans for an accessible version at this time. What do?

I made this workaround so that I can continue to use elinks in the office instead of getting distracted by the siren call of funny cat pictures on a different browser tab. This emulator attempts to reproduce the subset of the functionality of ADS Classic that I use on a regular basis, while issuing calls to the new API via the [ads](https://github.com/andycasey/ads) Python package.
